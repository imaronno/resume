            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Aronno, a passionate programmer from Bangladesh. Web development is my specialty, and I have been focused lately on mastering JavaScript after having experiences in HTML5 and CSS3. I enjoy bringing sites or applications to life-dynamic and interactive-that don't just look amazing but provide an amazing user experience as well.</p>
            
            <p>Other than my coding, I am working on projects, one of which is "Fresh Bites," a healthy recipe website, to showcase both front-end and back-end skills. Contributing actively to my GitHub repository "eat-healthy" where I share coding projects and collaborate with other developers.</p>
            
            <p>You can usually find me on Reddit discussing programming when I am not coding. I also read about new technologies in my free time. I believe in clarity and enjoy making things a little more approachable for everyone.</p>
            
            <p>I'm constantly searching for fresh prospects to develop my skills as a full-stack developer and take on some new exhilarating challenges in the magical realm of technology!</p>
